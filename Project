The Update Table component updates the KYC_RGN_MAIN.KYC_BATCH_STATISTICS table in the Oracle database with the final processing statistics for each batch. It receives input from the Join component containing computed totals and audit information such as total_process_cnt, failure_cnt, success_cnt, lst_upd_dt, lst_upd_time, and lst_upd_id.

For each batch record, the component executes an embedded SQL UPDATE statement (defined in the parameter updateSqlFile) that sets the total processed count, success count, failure count, and audit fields (LST_UPD_ID, LST_UPD_DT, LST_UPD_TIME). It also updates the field BATCH_STATUS to ‘COMPLETE’, indicating that the batch has finished all processing successfully.

The database connection configuration is provided through the parameter $DBC_FILE, and the database type is specified as dbms=oracle. The component uses parameters such as DBConfigFile=$DBC_FILE, ActionRequired=True, and ignoreDuplicates=compat for connection and execution control. If any record fails to update (for example, due to an invalid batch ID, missing keys, or SQL constraint errors), it is redirected to the Err File (defined in $FILE) for error handling and further investigation.
