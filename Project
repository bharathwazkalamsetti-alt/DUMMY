he Validate Input Feed graph validates the incoming feed file for structure, completeness, and accuracy. It reads the file through the Input File component using parameters $FILE_PATH, $DELIMITER, and $RECORD_FORMAT. The PBE (Partition by Expression) separates header, trailer, and detail records based on record_type. Components like Process Date Validation, Checksum Validation, and Record Count Validation verify key fields using parameters such as $PROCESS_DATE, $CKSUM_FIELD, and $REC_CNT_FIELD. The results are merged and written to $OUT_FILE_VALIDATION, producing a validation summary that confirms file integrity before processing
