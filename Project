Reformart :
The Reformat component generates batch control data using parameters such as shard_num, salt, and static system values.
It assigns a unique or fixed batch_id, defines job attributes (batch_cd, batch_descr), and sets regional identifiers (rgn_id, cntry_cd).
System-generated fields like create_id, lst_upd_id, timestamps, and process dates help keep a complete record of when and by whom the batch was created or updated.
This output acts as the batch header record, which is used later for loading data into the database and creating the batch file

Replicate :
it will create two file as copy one will sent to  table and another will sent to batch file(reformart-1)

Table:
It will create a table 

Reformart-1 :

This component adds a batch date and timestamp field to each record before sending the data to the output file (Batch File).
It helps track when the batch was generated, ensuring each record has a consistent timestamp for audit or reconciliation purposes.
