The Separate Segment Files process takes one large input file that contains different types of records and separates them into multiple smaller files based on the record type. The component looks at the field record_type in each record and sends it to the correct output file.

For example, records with type '0001' go to SEG0001, '0002' go to SEG0002, '0003' go to SEG0003, and all other records go to SEG0004. The file paths (like $SEG001_OUT_FILE) are defined for each output so the data for each record type is stored separately.
