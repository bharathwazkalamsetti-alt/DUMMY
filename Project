The graph extracts valid KYC transaction records from the Oracle table KYC_RGN_STG.${TABLE} using parameters like ${DBC_FILE} for database connection and ${TABLE} for dynamic table reference.
It filters records where LOAD_STATUS is 'ADD_CORE_KYC' or 'ADD_PRODUCT_SERVICES' and CREATE_DT is within 730 days to ensure recent and valid data.
The data is partitioned and sorted using ${PART_KEY} (fields such as ID, batch_dt, country, month, year) for optimized parallel processing.
Finally, outputs are generated — ${EXCP_FILE} for the GIW staging extract and ${GFCID_LIST_FILE} for client mapping — ensuring parameterized, reusable, and traceable data loads.
