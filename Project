The Update Table component updates the KYC_RGN_MAIN.KYC_BATCH_STATISTICS table in the Oracle database to mark a batch as FAILED when processing errors occur. It receives input from the Reformat component containing batch-level details such as batch_id, process_date, rgn_id, cntry_cd, and audit fields including lst_upd_dt, lst_upd_time, and lst_upd_id.

For each batch record, the component executes an embedded SQL UPDATE statement (defined in the parameter updateSqlFile) that sets the audit fields (LST_UPD_ID, LST_UPD_DT, LST_UPD_TIME) and updates the field BATCH_STATUS to 'FAILED', indicating that the batch has ended unsuccessfully due to errors encountered during processing.

The database connection configuration is provided through the parameter $DBC_FILE, and the database type is specified as dbms=oracle. The component uses parameters such as DBConfigFile=$DBC_FILE, ActionRequired=True, and ignoreDuplicates=compat to manage connection and execution behavior. If any record fails to update (for example, due to a missing batch_id, invalid data, or SQL constraint violations), it is redirected to the error output file (defined in $FILE) for handling and further investigation.
