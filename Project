Gather Validation :

Generate Records:
Initializes an empty dataset using parameters like ${PROCESS_DATE} and ${AS_OF_DT} as placeholders for validation results.
Provides a base input for all upcoming components to maintain consistent data formatting.

-(Reformat – Header Record Creation)

Defines static header fields — FILE_NAME, VALIDATION_TYPE, VALIDATION_STATUS, VALUE_RECEIVED, VALUE_CALCULATED — using constants.
Prepares a fixed header record for the validation summary output structure.

Ref-2-2 (Reformat – Validation Data Formatting)

Uses parameters like ${INPUT_FILE_NAME}, ${VALIDATION_TYPE}, ${VALIDATION_STATUS}, ${VALUE_RECEIVED}, and ${VALUE_CALCULATED} to format records.
Extracts and standardizes filenames and validation outputs for readability and reporting.

4️)Concatenate

Combines the header record from Ref-1 with formatted validation results from Ref-2.
Ensures a unified output where header and validation details appear sequentially.

5️)Concatenate-1

Merges data streams from multiple validation modules (e.g., record count, date, checksum) into one.
Uses parameters like ${PROCESS_DATE} to align all validation results in a single dataset.

6️)Validation Summary (Output File)

Writes the merged validation results into a final timestamped output file —
KYC_INTERFACE_GCB_NAM_GIW_REG_validation_result_${PROCESS_DATE}_${RUN_ID}.dat.
Provides a full validation audit trail based on key parameters like ${PROCESS_DATE}, ${RUN_ID}, and ${INPUT_FILE_NAME}
