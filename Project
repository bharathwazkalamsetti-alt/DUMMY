The Process Date Validation subgraph ensures that the input file being processed corresponds to the correct business process date. It begins by redefining the incoming header record structure using the Redefine Header Format component, which prepares the data for validation without altering its values. The reformatted header record is then passed to the Ref-Validate (Reformat) component, where the actual validation logic is applied.

The Ref-Validate component extracts the file’s process date from the header (file_timestamp field) by taking the first eight characters (in YYYYMMDD format) and compares it against the expected process date parameter ${PROCESS_DT}. If both dates match, the validation status is set to “Success”; otherwise, it is marked as “Failure.”
