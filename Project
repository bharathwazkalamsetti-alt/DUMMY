Create Data :
The Create Data component initializes a base record structure with parameters like ${INPUT_FILE_NAME} and ${INBOUND_DIR} to prepare seed data for validation and loading into the tracking process.
Reformart :
The Reformat component uses parameters like ${INPUT_FILE_NAME}, ${INBOUND_DIR}, ${TRAILER_DATA}, ${TRAILER_CT_POSN}, ${TRAILER_DELIMITER}, ${INPUT_FILE_LN_CT}, ${SOURCE_SYSTEM}, and ${AS_OF_DT} to generate a unique, validated audit record with file metadata and COUNT_MATCH (PASS/FAIL).
This structured record is then loaded into the KYC_INBOUND_FILE_TRACKER table for tracking inbound file status, validation results, and audit details.

Insert for reject records :
This component creates records for files that failed validation using parameters like ${FILE_NAME}, ${SOURCE_SYSTEM}, and ${AS_OF_DT}.
It marks them as “FAIL”, assigns default values (file_count = 0, trailer_count = 0), and loads them into the KYC_INBOUND_FILE_TRACKER table for tracking rejected files.

Gather :
The Gather component combines data from multiple inputs — such as valid and rejected records — into one unified data flow.

Gather inbound feed tracker :
This component loads the processed file information into the KYC_RGN_MAIN.KYC_INBOUND_FILE_TRACKER table .
It inserts each record with parameters such as :id, :file_name, :inbound_directory, :file_count, :trailer_count, :count_match, :source_system, :create_id, and :as_of_date, while system date (sysdate) is automatically populated for arrival_date and create_dt.

Log : The log component records successful execution details and process information into an output file for monitoring and audit purposes.
Error: The error component captures and writes records that failed during the database insertion into a separate error file for analysis and troubleshooting.


Reject: The reject component stores records rejected due to data validation or transformation issues, helping identify and correct bad data before reprocessing.
