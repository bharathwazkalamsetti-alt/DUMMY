Component :
Generate Records	Generates initial dummy records to start the data flow.
Prepares a simple structure used later for creating the header row.
Ref-1 (Reformat):
	Creates a static header record with field names for the summary.
Defines columns like FILE NAME, VALIDATION TYPE, STATUS, VALUE RECEIVED, and VALUE CALCULATED.
Ref-2 (Reformat):
	Formats the actual validation result data coming from earlier validations.
Cleans file names, replaces underscores, and maps received and calculated values.
Concatenate:
	Combines the header output (Ref-1) and data records (Ref-2).
Ensures both header and data flow sequentially into a single output stream.
Concatenate-1:
	Merges multiple validation result flows into one combined dataset.
Prepares the unified output for writing to the final summary file.
Validation Summary:
	Writes the final formatted validation summary to an output file.


Business Logic (Simple & Clear)

The Gather Validation Results graph collects validation outcomes from various checks (like record count or trailer validation) and compiles them into one summary report.
It first creates a header record using Ref-1 and formats the validation details using Ref-2.
Both outputs are merged using Concatenate components and written into the Validation Summary file as a pipe (“|”)-delimited report.
The final output provides a complete overview of all validation types, statuses, and values for each processed file.
